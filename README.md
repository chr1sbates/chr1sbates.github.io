# Why?

The reason behind the website is to create a portfolio that can be used as a CV to help promote myself and allow people to see what I can do.

# Is this website a template?

The website was created using a template which has been fully edited. The reason behind using the template was to have a functional base point to start allowing me to make the website public quicker whilst I create my own website from scratch.
